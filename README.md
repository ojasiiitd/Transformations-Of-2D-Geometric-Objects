# Transformations-Of-2D-Geometric-Objects

Applying **Scaling, Rotation and Transformation** operations on Polygons and Disks using Python3.

This is an integral part of :
* Computer Graphics
* Object Modelling
* Object Visualization

## Instructions to setup :
* Fork this repo.
* Use `git clone https://github.com/<your-githib-username>/Transformations-Of-2D-Geometric-Objects.git`
* Install pip3 on your system by `sudo apt-get install python3-pip` if not already installed.
* Install python3 tkinter by a simple `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
* Create a virtual environment by the name of **virtual**. Information in setting up virtualenv can be found [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/ "Pipenv & Virtual Environments").
* Enter your virtualenv by `source virtual/bin/activate`
* Do a `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
* Now run the python program by using `python GeometricObjects.py`.
